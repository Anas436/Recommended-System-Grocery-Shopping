# Recommended-System-Grocery-Shopping


## The Problem

Help customers make informed decisions about where to shop for their groceries. With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to know which store has the best deals, selection, and quality for the customer’s specific needs and preferences. The recommended system can help to alleviate this problem by providing personalised recommendations based on factors such as location, product availability, price, and customer reviews. By doing so, customers can save time and money while also ensuring they are satisfied with their grocery shopping experience.
